            <p class="sectionSubTag">Racing games are a video game genre in which the player participates in a racing
                competition. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to fantastical settings. They
                are distributed along a spectrum between more realistic racing simulations and more fantastical
                arcade-style racing games. Kart racing games emerged in the 1990s as a popular sub-genre of the latter.
                Racing games may also fall under the category of sports video games.</p>
